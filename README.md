use the command :%sDEFAUL_SIZE/DEFAULT_SIZE/g

Academic Integrity Question
You finished the PA since you started early, but your friend hasn’t and just started working on it even though it’s due tonight at 11:59 pm. Your friend knows you are done with the PA and has asked you to help them so they can finish in time. What do you do to act with integrity?

I will suggest my friend to ask TA or post his question on the Piazza. Share my textbook with him.
